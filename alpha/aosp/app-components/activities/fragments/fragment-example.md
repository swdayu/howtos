## Example

To bring everything discussed in this document together, 
here's an example of an activity using two fragments to create a two-pane layout. 
The activity below includes one fragment to show a list of Shakespeare play titles 
and another to show a summary of the play when selected from the list. 
It also demonstrates how to provide different configurations of the fragments, based on the screen configuration.

> **Note:** The complete source code for this activity is available in `FragmentLayout.java`.
