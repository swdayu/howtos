# Intents and Intent Filters

An `Intent` is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another `app component`. 
Although intents facilitate communication between components in several ways, 
there are three fundamental use-cases:

**意图**是一个信息传递对象，用于向其他**应用组件**请求执行相应动作。
尽管**意图**可以通过多种方式与其他组件沟通，但最基本的3种方式如下：

- **To start an activity:**

  An `Activity` represents a single screen in an app. 
  You can start a new instance of an `Activity` by passing an `Intent` to `startActivity()`. 
  The `Intent` describes the activity to start and carries any necessary data.
  
  **Activity**表示应用中的一个屏幕界面。
  通过**Intent**调用函数`startActivity()`可以启动一个新的**Activity**。
  **Intent**指定启动的**Activity**并携带必需的数据。
  
  If you want to receive a result from the activity when it finishes, call `startActivityForResult()`. 
  Your activity receives the result as a separate `Intent` object 
  in your activity's `onActivityResult()` callback. 
  For more information, see the `Activities` guide.

  如果要从**Activity**接收执行结果，应调用`startActivityForResult()`。
  执行结果会以不同的**Intent**对象传递到`onActivityResult()`回调函数中。
  更多信息参考[Activities](../2-activities/1-activities.md)。

- **To start a service:**

  A `Service` is a component that performs operations in the background without a user interface. 
  You can start a service to perform a one-time operation (such as download a file) 
  by passing an `Intent` to `startService()`. 
  The `Intent` describes the service to start and carries any necessary data.

  **Service**是没有界面在后台执行的组件。
  通过**Indent**调用函数`startService()`可以启动一个服务执行一次操作（如下载一个文件）。
  **Indent**指定启动的服务并携带必需的数据。
  
  If the service is designed with a client-server interface, 
  you can bind to the service from another component by passing an `Intent` to `bindService()`. 
  For more information, see the `Services` guide.
  
  如果服务提供客户访问接口，其他组件可以通过**Intent**调用`bindService()`绑定服务。
  更多信息参考[Services](../3-services/3-services.md)。
  
- **To deliver a broadcast:**

  A broadcast is a message that any app can receive. 
  The system delivers various broadcasts for system events, 
  such as when the system boots up or the device starts charging. 
  You can deliver a broadcast to other apps by passing an `Intent` to `sendBroadcast()`, 
  `sendOrderedBroadcast()`, or `sendStickyBroadcast()`.
  
  广播消息可以被任何应用接收。系统会发送很多系统事件的广播消息，例如当系统启动或开始充电时。
  通过**Indent**调用`sendBroadcast()`或`sendOrderedBroadcast()`或`sendStickyBroadcast()`
  可以发送广播消息给其他应用。

## Intent Types

There are two types of intents:

- **Explicit intents** specify the component to start by name (the fully-qualified class name). 
  You'll typically use an explicit intent to start a component in your own app, 
  because you know the class name of the activity or service you want to start. 
  For example, start a new activity in response to a user action or 
  start a service to download a file in the background.
  
- **Implicit intents** do not name a specific component, but instead declare a general action to perform, 
  which allows a component from another app to handle it. 
  For example, if you want to show the user a location on a map, 
  you can use an implicit intent to request that another capable app show a specified location on a map.

When you create an *explicit* intent to start an activity or service, 
the system immediately starts the app component specified in the `Intent` object.

When you create an *implicit* intent, the Android system finds the appropriate component to start 
by comparing the contents of the intent to the *intent filters* declared in the `manifest file` 
of other apps on the device. 
If the intent matches an intent filter, the system starts that component and delivers it the `Intent` object. 
If multiple intent filters are compatible, the system displays a dialog so the user can pick which app to use.

如果使用Implicit Intent，系统会根据它的内容与其他应用的Intent Filter进行比较。
如果匹配唯一的Intent Filter，系统会启动这个组件并将Intent传给它。
如果匹配多个，系统会显示一个对话框让用户选择使用哪一个。

An intent filter is an expression in an app's manifest file that specifies the type of intents 
that the component would like to receive. 
For instance, by declaring an intent filter for an activity, 
you make it possible for other apps to directly start your activity with a certain kind of intent. 
Likewise, if you do not declare any intent filters for an activity, 
then it can be started only with an explicit intent.

如果你的应用不定义Intent Filter，只能通过Explicit Intent启动它。

> **Caution:** To ensure your app is secure, 
always use an explicit intent when starting a `Service` and do not declare intent filters for your services. 
Using an implicit intent to start a service is a security hazard 
because you cannot be certain what service will respond to the intent, 
and the user cannot see which service starts. 
Beginning with Android 5.0 (API level 21), 
the system throws an exception if you call `bindService()` with an implicit intent.

为了保证应用的安全，建议只用Explicit Intent启动服务组件，并且不在服务中定义Intent Filter。

## Building an Intent

An `Intent` object carries information that the Android system uses to determine which component to start 
(such as the exact component name or component category that should receive the intent), 
plus information that the recipient component uses in order to properly perform the action 
(such as the action to take and the data to act upon).

The primary information contained in an `Intent` is the following:

- **Component name**
  
    The name of the component to start.

    This is optional, but it's the critical piece of information that makes an intent **explicit**, 
    meaning that the intent should be delivered only to the app component defined by the component name. 
    Without a component name, the intent is **implicit** and the system decides which component 
    should receive the intent based on the other intent information 
    (such as the action, data, and category—described below). 
    So if you need to start a specific component in your app, you should specify the component name.

    > **Note:** When starting a `Service`, you should always specify the component name. 
    Otherwise, you cannot be certain what service will respond to the intent, 
    and the user cannot see which service starts.

    This field of the `Intent` is a `ComponentName` object, which you can specify 
    using a fully qualified class name of the target component, including the package name of the app. 
    For example, `com.example.ExampleActivity`. You can set the component name with `setComponent()`, 
    `setClass()`, `setClassName()`, or with the `Intent` constructor.
    
- **Action**

    A string that specifies the generic action to perform (such as *view* or *pick*).

    In the case of a broadcast intent, this is the action that took place and is being reported. 
    The action largely determines how the rest of the intent is structured - particularly what is 
    contained in the data and extras.

    You can specify your own actions for use by intents within your app 
    (or for use by other apps to invoke components in your app), 
    but you should usually use action constants defined by the `Intent` class or other framework classes. 
    Here are some common actions for starting an activity:
    
    - **ACTION_VIEW**: Use this action in an intent with `startActivity()` when you have some information 
    that an activity can show to the user, such as a photo to view in a gallery app, 
    or an address to view in a map app.
    
    想呈现内容。
    
    - **ACTION_SEND**: Also known as the "share" intent, 
    you should use this in an intent with `startActivity()` when you have some data 
    that the user can share through another app, such as an email app or social sharing app.

    想发送数据。
    
    See the `Intent` class reference for more constants that define generic actions. 
    Other actions are defined elsewhere in the Android framework, such as in `Settings` 
    for actions that open specific screens in the system's Settings app.

    You can specify the action for an intent with `setAction()` or with an `Intent` constructor.

    If you define your own actions, be sure to include your app's package name as a prefix. For example:
    
        static final String ACTION_TIMETRAVEL = "com.example.action.TIMETRAVEL";

- **Data**

    The URI (a `Uri` object) that references the data to be acted on and/or the `MIME` type of that data. 
    The type of data supplied is generally dictated by the intent's action. 
    For example, if the action is `ACTION_EDIT`, the data should contain the URI of the document to edit.

    When creating an intent, it's often important to specify the type of data (its MIME type) 
    in addition to its URI. For example, an activity that's able to display images probably won't be able to 
    play an audio file, even though the URI formats could be similar. 
    So specifying the MIME type of your data helps the Android system find the best component 
    to receive your intent. However, the MIME type can sometimes be inferred from the URI - particularly 
    when the data is a `content`: which indicates the data is located on the device 
    and controlled by a `ContentProvider`, which makes the data MIME type visible to the system.

    To set only the data URI, call `setData()`. To set only the MIME type, call `setType()`. \
    If necessary, you can set both explicitly with `setDataAndType()`.

    > Caution: If you want to set both the URI and MIME type, do not call `setData()` and `setType()` 
    because they each nullify the value of the other. 
    Always use `setDataAndType()` to set both URI and MIME type.

- **Category**

    A string containing additional information about the kind of component that should handle the intent. 
    Any number of category descriptions can be placed in an intent, but most intents do not require a category.
    Here are some common categories:

    - **CATEGORY_BROWSABLE**: The target activity allows itself to be started by a web browser 
    to display data referenced by a link - such as an image or an e-mail message. 

    目标Activity可以被浏览器浏览。    

    - **CATEGORY_LAUNCHER**: The activity is the initial activity of a task 
    and is listed in the system's application launcher. 

    目标Activity是一个初始Activity，可以呈现在系统应用启动列表中。

    See the `Intent` class description for the full list of categories.

    You can specify a category with `addCategory()`.

These properties listed above (component name, action, data, and category) represent 
the defining characteristics of an intent. 
By reading these properties, the Android system is able to resolve which app component it should start.

However, an intent can carry additional information that does not affect how it is resolved to an app component. An intent can also supply:

Intent还可以包含一些额外信息，这些信息不影响应用组件的匹配。

- **Extras**: Key-value pairs that carry additional information required to accomplish the requested action. 
    Just as some actions use particular kinds of data URIs, some actions also use particular extras.

    You can add extra data with various `putExtra()` methods, each accepting two parameters: 
    the key name and the value. You can also create a `Bundle` object with all the extra data, 
    then insert the `Bundle` in the `Intent` with `putExtras()`.

    For example, when creating an intent to send an email with `ACTION_SEND`, 
    you can specify the "to" recipient with the `EXTRA_EMAIL` key, 
    and specify the "subject" with the `EXTRA_SUBJECT` key.

    The `Intent` class specifies many `EXTRA_*` constants for standardized data types. 
    If you need to declare your own extra keys (for intents that your app receives), 
    be sure to include your app's package name as a prefix. 
    For example:

        static final String EXTRA_GIGAWATTS = "com.example.EXTRA_GIGAWATTS";

- **Flags**: Flags defined in the `Intent` class that function as metadata for the intent. 
    The flags may instruct the Android system how to launch an activity 
    (for example, which `task` the activity should belong to) and how to treat it after it's launched 
    (for example, whether it belongs in the list of recent activities).

    For more information, see the `setFlags()` method.

## Example explicit intent

An explicit intent is one that you use to launch a specific app component, 
such as a particular activity or service in your app. 
To create an explicit intent, define the component name for the `Intent` object - 
all other intent properties are optional.

For example, if you built a service in your app, named `DownloadService`, 
designed to download a file from the web, you can start it with the following code:

```java
// Executed in an Activity, so 'this' is the Context
// The fileUrl is a string URL, such as "http://www.example.com/image.png"
Intent downloadIntent = new Intent(this, DownloadService.class);
downloadIntent.setData(Uri.parse(fileUrl));
startService(downloadIntent);
```

The `Intent(Context, Class)` constructor supplies the app `Context` and the component a `Class` object. 
As such, this intent explicitly starts the `DownloadService` class in the app.

For more information about building and starting a service, see the `Services` guide.

## Example implicit intent

An implicit intent specifies an action that can invoke any app on the device able to perform the action. 
Using an implicit intent is useful when your app cannot perform the action, 
but other apps probably can and you'd like the user to pick which app to use.

For example, if you have content you want the user to share with other people, 
create an intent with the `ACTION_SEND` action and add extras that specify the content to share. 
When you call `startActivity()` with that intent, 
the user can pick an app through which to share the content.

> **Caution:** It's possible that a user won't have any apps that handle the implicit intent 
you send to `startActivity()`. If that happens, the call will fail and your app will crash. 
To verify that an activity will receive the intent, call `resolveActivity()` on your `Intent` object. 
If the result is non-null, then there is at least one app that can handle the intent 
and it's safe to call `startActivity()`. If the result is null, you should not use the intent and, 
if possible, you should disable the feature that issues the intent.

```java
// Create the text message with a string
Intent sendIntent = new Intent();
sendIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, textMessage);
sendIntent.setType("text/plain");

// Verify that the intent will resolve to an activity
if (sendIntent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null) {
    startActivity(sendIntent);
}
```

> **Note:** In this case, a URI is not used, 
but the intent's data type is declared to specify the content carried by the extras.

When `startActivity()` is called, the system examines all of the installed apps 
to determine which ones can handle this kind of intent 
(an intent with the `ACTION_SEND` action and that carries "text/plain" data). 
If there's only one app that can handle it, that app opens immediately and is given the intent. 
If multiple activities accept the intent, the system displays a dialog so the user can pick which app to use.

## Forcing an app chooser

When there is more than one app that responds to your implicit intent, 
the user can select which app to use and make that app the default choice for the action. 
This is nice when performing an action for which the user probably wants to use the same app from now on, 
such as when opening a web page (users often prefer just one web browser) .

However, if multiple apps can respond to the intent and the user might want to use a different app each time, 
you should explicitly show a chooser dialog. 
The chooser dialog asks the user to select which app to use for the action every time 
(the user cannot select a default app for the action). 
For example, when your app performs "share" with the `ACTION_SEND` action, 
users may want to share using a different app depending on their current situation, 
so you should always use the chooser dialog, as shown in figure 2.

To show the chooser, create an `Intent` using `createChooser()` and pass it to `startActivity()`. 
For example:

```java
Intent sendIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
...

// Always use string resources for UI text.
// This says something like "Share this photo with"
String title = getResources().getString(R.string.chooser_title);
// Create intent to show the chooser dialog
Intent chooser = Intent.createChooser(sendIntent, title);

// Verify the original intent will resolve to at least one activity
if (sendIntent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null) {
    startActivity(chooser);
}
```

This displays a dialog with a list of apps that respond to the intent passed to the `createChooser()` method 
and uses the supplied text as the dialog title.

## Receiving an Implicit Intent

To advertise which implicit intents your app can receive, 
declare one or more intent filters for each of your app components with an `<intent-filter>` element 
in your manifest file. 
Each intent filter specifies the type of intents it accepts based on the intent's action, data, and category. 
The system will deliver an implicit intent to your app component 
only if the intent can pass through one of your intent filters.

> **Note:** An explicit intent is always delivered to its target, 
regardless of any intent filters the component declares.

An app component should declare separate filters for each unique job it can do. 
For example, one activity in an image gallery app may have two filters: 
one filter to view an image, and another filter to edit an image. 
When the activity starts, it inspects the `Intent` and decides how to behave 
based on the information in the `Intent` (such as to show the editor controls or not).

Each intent filter is defined by an `<intent-filter>` element in the app's `manifest file`, 
nested in the corresponding app component (such as an `<activity>` element). 
Inside the `<intent-filter>`, you can specify the type of intents to accept 
using one or more of these three elements:

- `<action>`: Declares the intent action accepted, in the `name` attribute. 
  The value must be the literal string value of an action, not the class constant.
- `<data>`: Declares the type of data accepted, using one or more attributes that 
  specify various aspects of the data URI (`scheme`, `host`, `port`, `path`, etc.) and MIME type.
- `<category>`: Declares the intent category accepted, in the `name` attribute. 
  The value must be the literal string value of an action, not the class constant.
  
    > Note: In order to receive implicit intents, you **must include** the `CATEGORY_DEFAULT` category 
    in the intent filter. The methods `startActivity()` and `startActivityForResult()` treat all intents 
    as if they declared the `CATEGORY_DEFAULT` category. If you do not declare this category 
    in your intent filter, no implicit intents will resolve to your activity.

For example, here's an activity declaration with an intent filter to receive an `ACTION_SEND` intent 
when the data type is text:

```xml
<activity android:name="ShareActivity">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    <data android:mimeType="text/plain"/>
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

It's okay to create a filter that includes more than one instance of `<action>`, `<data>`, or `<category>`. 
If you do, you simply need to be certain that the component can handle any and all combinations 
of those filter elements.

When you want to handle multiple kinds of intents, but only in specific combinations of action, data, 
and category type, then you need to create multiple intent filters.

An implicit intent is tested against a filter by comparing the intent to each of the three elements. 
To be delivered to the component, the intent must pass all three tests. 
If it fails to match even one of them, the Android system won't deliver the intent to the component. 
However, because a component may have multiple intent filters, 
an intent that does not pass through one of a component's filters might make it through on another filter. 
More information about how the system resolves intents is provided in the section below about `Intent Resolution`.

**Restricting access to components**

Using an intent filter is not a secure way to prevent other apps from starting your components. 
Although intent filters restrict a component to respond to only certain kinds of implicit intents, 
another app can potentially start your app component by using an explicit intent 
if the developer determines your component names. 
If it's important that only your own app is able to start one of your components, 
set the `exported` attribute to `"false"` for that component.

如果你的组件只想在自己的应用中启动，可以将组件的`exported`属性设为`"false"`。

> **Caution:** To avoid inadvertently running a different app's `Service`, 
always use an explicit intent to start your own service and do not declare intent filters for your service.

> **Note:** For all activities, you must declare your intent filters in the manifest file. 
However, filters for broadcast receivers can be registered dynamically by calling `registerReceiver()`. 
You can then unregister the receiver with `unregisterReceiver()`. 
Doing so allows your app to listen for specific broadcasts during only a specified period of time 
while your app is running.

所有Activity的Intent Filter都必须定义在Manifest文件中。
但是Broadcast Receiver可以调用`registerReceiver()`和`unregisterReceiver()`进行动态注册。

## Example filters

To better understand some of the intent filter behaviors, 
look at the following snippet from the manifest file of a social-sharing app.

```xml
<activity android:name="MainActivity">
  <!-- This activity is the main entry, should appear in app launcher -->
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>

<activity android:name="ShareActivity">
  <!-- This activity handles "SEND" actions with text data -->
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    <data android:mimeType="text/plain"/>
  </intent-filter>
  <!-- This activity also handles "SEND" and "SEND_MULTIPLE" with media data -->
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND"/>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND_MULTIPLE"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    <data android:mimeType="application/vnd.google.panorama360+jpg"/>
    <data android:mimeType="image/*"/>
    <data android:mimeType="video/*"/>
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

The first activity, `MainActivity`, is the app's main entry point - the activity that 
opens when the user initially launches the app with the launcher icon:
- The `ACTION_MAIN` action indicates this is the main entry point and does not expect any intent data.
- The `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER` category indicates that this activity's icon 
  should be placed in the system's app launcher. 
  If the `<activity>` element does not specify an icon with `icon`,
  then the system uses the icon from the `<application>` element.

These two must be paired together in order for the activity to appear in the app launcher.

必须定义这两项使Activity能够显示在应用启动列表中。

The second activity, `ShareActivity`, is intended to facilitate sharing text and media content. 
Although users might enter this activity by navigating to it from `MainActivity`, 
they can also enter `ShareActivity` directly from another app that issues an implicit intent 
matching one of the two intent filters.

> **Note:** The MIME type, `application/vnd.google.panorama360+jpg`, 
is a special data type that specifies panoramic photos, which you can handle with the Google panorama APIs.

## Using a Pending Intent

A `PendingIntent` object is a wrapper around an `Intent` object. 
The primary purpose of a `PendingIntent` is to grant permission to a foreign application 
to use the contained `Intent` as if it were executed from your app's own process.

Major use cases for a pending intent include:
- Declare an intent to be executed when the user performs an action with your `Notification`
  (the Android system's `NotificationManager` executes the `Intent`).
- Declare an intent to be executed when the user performs an action with your `App Widget` 
  (the Home screen app executes the `Intent`).
- Declare an intent to be executed at a specified time in the future 
  (the Android system's `AlarmManager` executes the `Intent`). 

Because each `Intent` object is designed to be handled by a specific type of app component 
(either an `Activity`, a `Service`, or a `BroadcastReceiver`), 
so too must a `PendingIntent` be created with the same consideration. 
When using a pending intent, your app will not execute the intent with a call such as `startActivity()`. 
You must instead declare the intended component type when you create the `PendingIntent` 
by calling the respective creator method:
- `PendingIntent.getActivity()` for an `Intent` that starts an `Activity`.
- `PendingIntent.getService()` for an `Intent` that starts a `Service`.
- `PendingIntent.getBroadcast()` for an `Intent` that starts an `BroadcastReceiver`.

Unless your app is receiving pending intents from other apps, 
the above methods to create a `PendingIntent` are the only `PendingIntent` methods you'll probably ever need.

Each method takes the current app `Context`, the `Intent` you want to wrap, 
and one or more flags that specify how the intent should be used 
(such as whether the intent can be used more than once).

More information about using pending intents is provided with the documentation 
for each of the respective use cases, such as in the `Notifications` and `App Widgets` API guides.

## Intent Resolution

When the system receives an implicit intent to start an activity, it searches for the best activity 
for the intent by comparing the intent to intent filters based on three aspects:
- The intent action
- The intent data (both URI and data type)
- The intent category 

The following sections describe how intents are matched to the appropriate component(s) 
in terms of how the intent filter is declared in an app's manifest file.

### Action test

To specify accepted intent actions, an intent filter can declare zero or more `<action>` elements. 
For example:
```xml
<intent-filter>
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.EDIT" />
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
  ...
</intent-filter>
```
To get through this filter, the action specified in the `Intent` must match 
one of the actions listed in the filter.

If the filter does not list any actions, there is nothing for an intent to match, 
so all intents fail the test. However, if an `Intent` does not specify an action, 
it will pass the test (as long as the filter contains at least one action).

如果Filter不定义任何Action，所有来匹配的Intent都会失败。
另外只要Filter至少定义了一个Action，没有指定Action的Intent都会与之匹配成功。

### Category test

To specify accepted intent categories, an intent filter can declare zero or more `<category>` elements. 
For example:

```xml
<intent-filter>
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
  ...
</intent-filter>
```

For an intent to pass the category test, every category in the `Intent` must match a category in the filter. 
The reverse is not necessary - the intent filter may declare more categories 
than are specified in the `Intent` and the `Intent` will still pass. 
Therefore, an intent with no categories should always pass this test, 
regardless of what categories are declared in the filter.

如果Intent没有指定任何Category，会与任何Filter的Category匹配。

> **Note:** Android automatically applies the the `CATEGORY_DEFAULT` category to all implicit intents 
passed to `startActivity()` and `startActivityForResult()`. 
So if you want your activity to receive implicit intents, 
it must include a category for `"android.intent.category.DEFAULT"` in its intent filters, 
as shown in the previous `<intent-filter>` example.

注意，Android自动为调用`startActivity()`和`startActivityForResult()`的Intent加上了`CATEGORY_DEFAULT`。
因此为了让你的Activity能够收到Implicit Intent，你的Filter必须定义`“android.intent.category.DEFAULT”`。

### Data test

To specify accepted intent data, an intent filter can declare zero or more `<data>` elements. 
For example:

```xml
<intent-filter>
  <data android:mimeType="video/mpeg" android:scheme="http" ... />
  <data android:mimeType="audio/mpeg" android:scheme="http" ... />
  ...
</intent-filter>
```

Each `<data>` element can specify a URI structure and a data type (MIME media type). 
There are separate attributes - `scheme`, `host`, `port`, and `path` - for each part of the URI:
```
<scheme>://<host>:<port>/<path>
```

For example: 
```
content://com.example.project:200/folder/subfolder/etc
```

In this URI, the scheme is `content`, the host is `com.example.project`, the port is `200`, 
and the path is `folder/subfolder/etc`.

Each of these attributes is optional in a `<data>` element, but there are linear dependencies:
- If a scheme is not specified, the host is ignored.
- If a host is not specified, the port is ignored.
- If both the scheme and host are not specified, the path is ignored.

When the URI in an intent is compared to a URI specification in a filter, 
it's compared only to the parts of the URI included in the filter. 
For example:
- If a filter specifies only a scheme, all URIs with that scheme match the filter.
- If a filter specifies a scheme and an authority but no path, 
  all URIs with the same scheme and authority pass the filter, regardless of their paths.
- If a filter specifies a scheme, an authority, and a path, 
  only URIs with the same scheme, authority, and path pass the filter.

如果Filter指定了Scheme，Itent必须指定相同的Scheme才匹配；
如果Filter指定了Scheme和Authority，Itent必须指定相同的Scheme和Authority才匹配，而不考虑Path。
如果Filter指定了Scheme、Authority和Path，Itent必须都要相同才匹配。

> **Note:** A `path` specification can contain a wildcard asterisk (`*`) 
to require only a partial match of the path name.

特别的是，Filter中Path可以使用通配符，Itent中的Path只要部分匹配就行。

The data test compares both the URI and the MIME type in the intent 
to a URI and MIME type specified in the filter. 
The rules are as follows:
- An intent that contains neither a URI nor a MIME type passes the test 
  only if the filter does not specify any URIs or MIME types.
- An intent that contains a URI but no MIME type (neither explicit nor inferable from the URI) passes the test
  only if its URI matches the filter's URI format and the filter likewise does not specify a MIME type.
- An intent that contains a MIME type but not a URI passes the test 
  only if the filter lists the same MIME type and does not specify a URI format.
- An intent that contains both a URI and a MIME type (either explicit or inferable from the URI) 
  passes the MIME type part of the test only if that type matches a type listed in the filter. 
  It passes the URI part of the test either if its URI matches a URI in the filter or 
  if it has a `content:` or `file:` URI and the filter does not specify a URI. 
  In other words, a component is presumed to support `content:` and `file:` data 
  if its filter lists only a MIME type.

如Intent指定了URI和MIME，MIME必须相同，如果URI也相同则匹配成功；
如果URI是`content:`或`file:`URI并且Filter没有指定URI，也匹配成功。

This last rule reflects the expectation that components are able to get local data 
from a file or content provider. 
Therefore, their filters can list just a data type and 
do not need to explicitly name the `content:` and `file:` schemes. 
This is a typical case. 
A `<data>` element like the following, for example, 
tells Android that the component can get image data from a content provider and display it:

```xml
<intent-filter>
  <data android:mimeType="image/*" />
  ...
</intent-filter>
```

Because most available data is dispensed by content providers, 
filters that specify a data type but not a URI are perhaps the most common. 

Another common configuration is filters with a scheme and a data type. 
For example, a `<data>` element like the following tells Android that 
the component can retrieve video data from the network in order to perform the action:

```xml
<intent-filter>
  <data android:scheme="http" android:type="video/*" />
  ...
</intent-filter>
```

## Intent matching

Intents are matched against intent filters not only to discover a target component to activate, 
but also to discover something about the set of components on the device. 
For example, the Home app populates the app launcher by finding all the activities 
with intent filters that specify the `ACTION_MAIN` action and `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER` category.

Your application can use intent matching in a similar way. 
The `PackageManager` has a set of `query...()` methods 
that return all components that can accept a particular intent, 
and a similar series of `resolve...()` methods 
that determine the best component to respond to an intent. 
For example, `queryIntentActivities()` returns a list of all activities 
that can perform the intent passed as an argument, 
and `queryIntentServices()` returns a similar list of services. 
Neither method activates the components; they just list the ones that can respond. 
There's a similar method, `queryBroadcastReceivers()`, for broadcast receivers.
